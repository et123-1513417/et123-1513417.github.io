				<h1>Welcome to my first Web Page</h1>
					<p>This is an HTML page that I created in TextWrangler.</p>
						<p>I'm adding a new paragraph because I want to see how superscripts and subscripts work in HTML 
						"On the 4<sup>th</sup> I'm going to the space station to see the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere"</p>
				<p>I'm gonna keep on messing around cause this is not only my first website but it will be my last first website</p>
				<hr />
				<p>This is all besides the point cause I haven't even learned CSS yet so all this looks terrible</p>
				<p.dotted {border-style: dotted;}>Wanna hear a bad joke?<br />A random guy entered a local paper's pun contest he sent in ten puns hoping one would win but...<br />No pun in-ten-did</p>
					<p>Pretty <strong>FUNNY</strong> huh... it's actually not. Hopefully my <strong>mom</strong> never looks at this...</p>
					<p>Ok I don't know what this <em>emphasis</em> stuff is but it looks like italics in a word processor. And I just found out that they don't have spell
					check in TextWrangler.</p>

						<p><strong>Preach it</strong>... Isaac Asimov is a stupid name but the guy knew at least one thing. He also said, <q>I don't trust the man that 
						calls himself the Kool Aid Man</q> but people don't really remember that one.</p>
